<div>
    If the name starts from '/', like "/foo/bar/zot", then it's interpreted as absolute.
    Otherwise, the name should be something like "foo/bar" and it's interpreted like
    relative path name in the file system is, against the given context.
    <p>
        For compatibility, as a fallback when nothing else matches, a simple path
        like "foo/bar" can also be treated as "/foo/bar".
